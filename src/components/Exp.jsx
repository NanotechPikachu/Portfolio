I haven&apos;t worked on any officially recognized project but have been working on different simple projects of my own and also helped others in whatever way I could.
<br /> <br />
As such, I don&apos;t have any official experience nor any certificates to prove my skills. But, I can assure that whatever work I do, <i>I will put my whole heart into it!</i>
